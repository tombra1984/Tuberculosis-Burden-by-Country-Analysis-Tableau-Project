Project/Goals

This project involved turning data derived from WHO about the Tuberculosis burden by country into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau. It reqiured creating impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions, based on business questions and communicating these insights with the correct visualizations.

Process

Download and connect with data in Tableau.
Analize the dataset and identify the different data types present.
Clean the dataset removing null values.
Build different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. 
Define questions that would be answered using the features in the dataset.
Identify trends.

Results

Tuberculosis Burden by Country

There were four (4) main data questions 
1. Which country had the most TB prevalence and deaths worldwide
2. Which Region/country had the most prevalence and deaths associated with TB
3. Which Countries in Africa are most affected?
4. What does the future hold for the world concerning TB?

To answer the first question, a map of the world highligthing the different countries with their associated TB prevalence and deaths was made. It identified India as having the most TB prevalence with over 97 million estimated cases and about an estimated 10 million deaths during the time frame.

To know the Region that had the most TB Prevalence and deaths, a packed bubbles plot alongside a pie chart was made. These plots showed that South East Asia (SEA), had over 147 million estimated Prevalent cases and had a death profile of just over an estimated 17 million. However, Africa (AFR) which had a lower Prevalence of about an estimated 60 million had an almost equivalent death profile of about 16.7 million cases. 

To understand the counrties in Africa that are most affected with TB, a geographic map, bars and a heat map was used. These visualizations identified Nigeria as having the highest TB prevalence and deaths with South Africa coming a close second. Nigeria had an estimated 10 million people with TB and an estimated 4million deaths while South Africa had an estimated 2 million deaths and an estimated 7 million cases. A relationship was observed between TB deaths and HIV as higher deaths were associated with cases that had HIV positive status (e.g South Africa).
 
With the aid of line charts and forecasting, less than 5million estimated deaths would be recorded in the next 3 years whereas TB prevalence worldwide is estimated to  drop to less than 10 million. Regionally, each region's incident cases would continue on the same trajectory as presently.

Challenges

Finding the right Visualization to use to convey the results appropriately.

Deciding what was necessary to put on the dashboard. 

Future Goals

Arrange the dashboards better.

Look for better visual combinations to convey the results.
